HypnoS (basic code) is a free UCI chess engine derived from Stockfish, 
used exclusively with OpenBench SPRT Testing Framework for Chess Engines.

HypnoS development is currently supported on the Openbench framework. OpenBench (created by Andrew Grant) is an open-source Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT) framework designed for self-play testing of engines. OpenBench makes use of distributed computing, allowing anyone to contribute CPU time to further the development of some of the world's most powerful engines.

A big thank you goes to the guys at http://chess.grantnet.us/ especially to Andrew Grant for running and improving this testing framework
